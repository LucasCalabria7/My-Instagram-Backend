## üìÑ Description
1. My Instagram Documentation and Layered Architecture
    - Index.ts page it's resposible for the requests itself, calling the routers and starting the process.
    - Controller Layer it's resposible for receiving the requests and return the responses checking only if the data it's coming or not.
    - Business Layer it's responsible for the business rules, in other words, it check if the data it's coming on the right shape (objects and injections).
    - Database Layer contains a raw request, it has the responsibility to connect the API with the database, receiving an order and returning the right answer.
    - Models, Interfaces and DTOS folders separate which type is going to be send to each layer, here you can find all types founded on the application, business and database ones.
    - instaDatabase.sql contains all the SQL syntax code; there you can have access to the mocked data.
    - API created and consumed using POSTMANN platform.
